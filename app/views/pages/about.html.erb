            Hey, Iâ€™m Rey Mar. I am working at Office Partners 360 as a Web and Zoho Developer. 
            I also create projects or any applications regarding machine learning and Internet of Things(IOT).
        </p>
        <p>
            I learned hardware and software troubleshooting on my first internship at Cebu SmartBuild,
            an IT company in Cebu which specializes in networking products, FDAs and other technical
            process or solutions involving technology. After Cebu SmartBuild,
            I got my first shot in web development as web developer intern for almost 3 months
            at Getmore Philippines where I got a chance to work on Ruby-on-Rails and Ember.js,
            a web framework, and able to used bitbucket and github as a requirement for version control.
            I was hired by Office Partners 360 as a fulltime web developer and part of the admin team. 
            OP360 gives me an opportunity to explore, learn and integrate different technologies from 
            Low Code platform to web frameworks.
